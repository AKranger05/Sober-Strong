Sober & Strong — Relapse-Based Habit Tracker (Frontend)

• Built a responsive, browser-based habit tracking web application focused on tracking time since last relapse for negative habits.
• Implemented a real-time timer (days, hours, minutes, seconds) that automatically resets upon relapse using vanilla JavaScript.
• Designed and developed a clean, supportive UI with mobile-first and desktop-responsive layouts using HTML and CSS.
• Implemented client-side data persistence using browser localStorage to store habits, relapse history, timestamps, and user reflections without a backend.
• Created a relapse logging system allowing users to record triggers, date, and time to help identify behavioral patterns over time.
• Focused on clean code structure, state management, and defensive programming for reliable frontend-only data handling.
